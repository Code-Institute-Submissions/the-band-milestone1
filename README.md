1. Project Name

The project name is "The Doors". This website is to present the band itself along with some pictures. 
Since they are mostly garage band, which plays at small family parties, weddings we will include some of the sample songs and videos to present the type of the music they play.
We will add a contact form, so in case people are interested in get in contact with the group to book them for a performance or simply enquire about the offer.. 

------------------------------------

2. UX

This website is for people interested in hiring a band for private venues.
By presenting the material on the website we hope it will be possible for potential clients to verify the music type performed.

As a potential customer we want the website to provide all relevant information that will allow you to make a decision if we are the suitable band to play on you venues.
As a potential music producer we want to show you the type of music we are playing.
